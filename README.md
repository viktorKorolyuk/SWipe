<i>As your browser loads the webpage, you find yourself faced with a dusty-black background containing instructions and a white button with text hinting that it commences a routine upon clicking it.<br>
You read the vauge instructions and press the  button. Immediately, two thin white bars begin to slowly decrease in longness.<br>
Following the instructions, you match the left-most coloured square to the square matching its color on the direct right of the first square using your arrow keys.<br>
As you progress through the game, you notice that the thin-white bars increase their compression speed each time you accumulate points.<br>
Soon the compression speed becomes so large that it's impossible for you to continue past a certain amount. <br>
As you realize the game is designed to be impossible, you have less desire to play it. You close the window, and search for a new source of entertainment in the beautiful world of the internet.</i>

## Game
The game is designed to test human reflex speeds and ability to differenciate colour in a "fun" and "engaging" manner.
