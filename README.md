*As your browser loads the webpage, you find yourself faced with a dusty-black background containing instructions and a white button with text hinting that it commences a routine upon clicking it.<br>
You read the vauge instructions and press the  button. Immediately, two thin white bars begin to slowly decrease in longness.<br>
Following the instructions, you match the left-most coloured square to the square matching its color on the direct right of the first square using your arrow keys.<br>
As you progress through the game, you notice that the thin-white bars increase their compression speed each time you accumulate points.<br>
Soon the compression speed rises to a large value that makes continuing the game impossible for you.<br>
As you realize the game is designed to be impossible, you have less desire to play it. Finaly, you close the window, and navigate to your favorite search engine to find the next source of entertainment tangled in the vast gossamer known as the Internet.</i>
