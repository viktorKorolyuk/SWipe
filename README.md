As your browser loads the webpage, you find a poorly designed webpage.<br>
You notice a start button at the top of the page.<br>
To your suprise, when you click the button, a timer begins to count down.<br>
Everytime you click a correct key on the webpage, the timer gets pushed back.<br>
-but it counts down faster each time.

You grow tired of the game and close the window, searching for a new source of entertainment.
