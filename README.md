As your browser loads the webpage, you find a poorly designed ui.<br>
You notice a start button at the top of the page.<br>
Out of sheer curiosity you click the button. A timer begins to count down.<br>
Panicked, you read the instructions at the top of the page and begin to play.
Everytime you click a correct key on the webpage, the timer gets pushed back; but everytime is decreases by shorter and shorter factors.<br>

You grow tired of the game and close the window, searching for a new source of entertainment in the beautiful world of the internet.
